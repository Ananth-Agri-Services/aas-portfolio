			<center><b><h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, serif;"><b>How Drone Technology Is Bringing Environmental
Benefits to Farms</b></h2></b></center>
			<img src="https://www.farminguk.com/images/News/54681_1.jpg" style="position:relative;width:35%;height:35%;" align='left' hspace="20" vspace="10"><p style="font-size:20px;">A vast proportion of the earth’s land mass is farmland, and
farming provides a livelihood for many. Geographically, environmentally, and
economically, farming’s contribution to our society, culture and surroundings
cannot be overstated. Inevitably, though, farming can have an impact on the
environment, given the industry’s reliance on natural resources, and this is the
source of much heated debate among environmentalists and the wider public.
Whilst opponents of the farming sector might say otherwise, farmers generally are
committed environmentalists and are constantly looking for best practice ideas to
minimize any environmental issues. One area that is gaining a lot of attention in
this regard is the use of drones within agriculture, with drone technology showing
promising signs of making a real difference to the way the farming industry
operates. The use of drones has been something of a revolution for many in the
farming industry, and it is rapidly changing the way farmers operate, across all
types of farm. Whilst an investment in high-end drone equipment may be
expensive, the opportunities for cost savings and environmental improvements
make it a serious proposition. Rather than using tractors and quad bikes, which use
petrol and produce harmful emissions, farmers are turning to drones, which use
clean electricity. Such pinpoint analysis of crops means that farmers are able to
determine precisely what their crops need in terms of fertilizer, herbicides or
pesticides, and to only apply chemicals in the quantities actually needed. Overapplication of chemicals quickly becomes a thing of the past, and crop yields are
improved, giving further environmental and economic benefits.</p>
			
			<img src="https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2018/11/Drone-servey.jpg" style="position:relative;width:35%;height:35%;" align='right' hspace="20" vspace="10"><p style="font-size:20px;">Drones aren’t just limited to aerial surveying within agriculture. Drone
technology has progressed hugely in recent times, and drones are now capable of
actually spraying crops. Again, the precision with which drones can be directed
means that chemicals can be laser-targeted to the specific part of a field that needs
treating, reducing chemical application to the absolute minimum. Since pollution
caused by run-off from farmland is a real problem within agriculture, this precision
application of chemicals is a welcome move. Drones also have an advantage over
manned vehicles in areas of the world where the terrain, or even disease, makes it
difficult to go to. The possibilities for actually treating animals in the field, direct
from a drone, are already being explored, and it seems only a matter of time before routine treatments can be administered to livestock in this way. Drones give
operators an amazingly precise and in-depth analytical tool, with the ability to go
anywhere, regardless of terrain or environmental constraints, and all within a
matter of minutes. The depth of analysis that can be achieved using drones is
enabling farmers to identify exactly which parts of their farms are healthy, spotting
problems at the earliest possible stage and sometimes even pre-empting issues
entirely. The environmental benefits of this are obvious, and it is even hoped that
drones will enable the farming industry to minimize the chances of major issues
occurring, from diseases like foot and mouth, to massive crop failures or serious
pollution incidents. Farming may not always be seen as a technology innovator,
but when it comes to drones, the industry is very definitely leading the field..</p>
<!--<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/fc/d6/0bfcd61ddeda3da56fa70e98dbffb11e.jpg" style="position:relative;width:35%;height:35%;" align='left' hspace="20" vspace="10"><p style="font-size:20px;">The traditional livestock industry is a sector that is widely overlooked and under-serviced, although it is
arguably the most vital. Livestock provides much needed renewable, natural resources that we rely on
every day. Livestock management has traditionally been known as running the business of poultry
farms, dairy farms, cattle ranches, or other livestock-related agribusinesses. Livestock managers must
keep accurate financial records, supervise workers, and ensure proper care and feeding of animals. This
technology can come in the form of nutritional technologies, genetics, digital technology, and more.
Livestock technology can enhance or improve the productivity capacity, welfare, or management of
animals and livestock.</p>-->

generator for the country but more people in India depend on agriculture than any other sectors.
The uniqueness of the region lies in agriculture being more than just a profession, it provides
sustenance and livelihood, and is entwined with social and cultural beliefs. Ironically, agriculture
has seen the least modernization in India than any other sector. There are many aspects that can
be modernized in India and be up to date with the rest of world such as mechanization, postharvest, logistics but everything starts with a better seed. Innovation is more important in modern
agriculture than ever before. The industry as a whole is facing huge challenges, from rising costs of
supplies, a shortage of labor, and changes in consumer preferences for transparency and sustainability.
There is increasing recognition from agriculture corporations that solutions are needed for these
challenges. Major technology innovations in the space have focused around areas such as indoor
vertical farming, automation and robotics, livestock technology, modern greenhouse practices,
precision agriculture.</p>
